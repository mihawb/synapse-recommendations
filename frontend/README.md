# SR Frontend

### How to run
Make sure you stand in frontend root directory in your terminal of choice and run `npm install` to load dependencies. Then run `npm start` to start the development server.  
Create production deployment build by running `npm run build`. It should reside in `backend/build` directory, and is moved there automatically, for compatibility with backend and CI/CD pipelines.
